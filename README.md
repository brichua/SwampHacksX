Tired of group projects with poor communication, nonexistent planning, and accountable teammates? Introducing StudySync, a collaborative platform built to help students streamline the group project experience, while also providing educators the tools they need to keep their students accountable.

Here, students can join classes and project groups created by their educator. In these projects groups, they can allocate tasks among their group members. Each group members task completion status is displayed on this page. Every student also gets notifications whenever a task is completed or uncompleted.
In order to reinforce the element of accountability, students can submit anonymous peer reviews which can be viewed by the teacher/educator of the class their in.

Educators can create classes in which their students can join and in these classes they can also create the project groups described above. Classes and project groups can be joined using a code provided to the instructor.
Educators can view all of the same elements of a project group (tasks,notifications, etc.) as the student but can't personally assign or complete tasks. On their project group page, they can also view all anonymous peer reviews. 
The educator is also given various statistics on their class that collates information about all project groups in it. This includes overall positive/neutral/negative ratio of peer feedback, completion progress of various groups, and data on what times tasks are being marked as completed.
